# Tyoaikakirjaus
Ty√∂aikakirjaus is a web application for tracking working hours. The front-end code is made with React and the back-end uses Google Firebase services. 

The application has two views, one for employees and one for supervisors. In the Employee view the employee can make check in between 7:20 - 9:10 and check out can be made after 8h 04min from check in. The page also shows work hour data from 6 previous days.

The supervisor view shows the list of employees. The supervisor can open employee's work hour data by pressing the button next to the employee's name. Employee's work hour data is displayed one month at a time on the work schedule page. 

Firebase services are protected with the App Check -feature, meaning it only allows database calls from the certain server.
